# **Mocks Overview**

The `__mocks__` directory is designed to provide mock implementations and utilities for testing purposes in the Voice-Controlled Kiosk Demo application. These mocks are essential for isolating tests, ensuring that they are focused on specific functionality without relying on external factors or dependencies.

## **Directory Structure**

```bash
/__mocks__
└── zustand.ts
```

### **Files and Their Roles**

- **`zustand.ts`**: Provides a mock implementation of Zustand, the state management library used in this application. This mock allows for testing the application’s state slices and store in isolation, ensuring that the tests are deterministic and reliable.

## **Why Use Mocks?**

Mocks are used to simulate parts of the application in a controlled way. By mocking Zustand, we can:

1. **Isolate Tests**: Ensure that each test only evaluates the logic it is supposed to, without interference from other parts of the application.
2. **Increase Test Reliability**: By using mocks, tests become more predictable and less likely to fail due to unrelated changes or external factors.
3. **Improve Test Performance**: Mocks can speed up tests by removing the need to initialize the full application state or make actual API calls.

## **Mocking Zustand**

### **Why Mock Zustand?**

Zustand is a state management library that allows for managing application state in a simple and efficient way. However, when testing, we want to avoid having our tests depend on the actual Zustand store. Instead, we mock Zustand to provide a controlled environment where we can test state-related logic independently.

### **How It Works**

1. **Custom `create` Function**:
    - The mock `zustand.ts` file overrides Zustand's `create` function. This allows the tests to create isolated instances of the store for each test case, ensuring no state leakage between tests.

2. **State Isolation**:
    - Each test can create its own instance of the store with its own state, preventing interference between test cases. This is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of tests, particularly in complex applications.

3. **Simplified Testing**:
    - By mocking Zustand, we can focus purely on the business logic and state management within each test. We can simulate various scenarios, manipulate the state directly, and assert the expected outcomes without concern for the underlying implementation details of Zustand.

## **How to Use the Mock**

### **Importing the Mock**

When writing tests, you should import the mocked Zustand `create` function from the `__mocks__` directory:

```typescript
import { create } from "../__mocks__/zustand";
```

### **Creating the Mock Store**

Use the mocked `create` function to initialize the store in your test files. For example:

```typescript
import { create } from "../__mocks__/zustand";
import { createOrderSlice, type OrderSlice } from "../store/slices/orderSlice";

type TestStore = OrderSlice;

const useOrderStore = create<TestStore>((...a) => ({
 ...createOrderSlice(...a),
}));
```

This setup allows each test case to work with a fresh instance of the store, ensuring that the state is reset between tests.

### **Best Practices**

- **Always Reset State**: Ensure that the state is reset between tests to prevent one test’s state from affecting another.
- **Mock Dependencies**: If your state logic interacts with external dependencies (like APIs), mock these dependencies to keep your tests focused and reliable.
- **Test Edge Cases**: Use the mock to simulate edge cases and unusual scenarios, ensuring that your state management logic handles them correctly.

### **Example Usage**

Here’s an example of how to use the mocked store in a test case:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { create } from "../__mocks__/zustand";
import { createOrderSlice, type OrderSlice } from "../store/slices/orderSlice";

type TestStore = OrderSlice;

const useOrderStore = create<TestStore>((...a) => ({
 ...createOrderSlice(...a),
}));

describe("OrderSlice", () => {
 it("should add an item to the order", () => {
  const store = useOrderStore.getState();

  store.addItemToOrder({
   id: "burger",
   name: "Burger",
   price: 5.99,
   quantity: 1,
  });

  const updatedState = useOrderStore.getState();
  expect(updatedState.currentOrder).toHaveLength(1);
  expect(updatedState.currentOrder[0].name).toBe("Burger");
 });
});
```

### **Conclusion**

The `__mocks__` directory is crucial for ensuring that your tests are reliable, isolated, and focused. By mocking Zustand, you can confidently test your state management logic without worrying about side effects or external dependencies. This approach helps maintain the overall quality and stability of the Voice-Controlled Kiosk Demo application.
